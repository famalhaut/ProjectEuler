Coded triangle numbers
Problem 42 
The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten 
triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and 
adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 
19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word 
a triangle word.

Using p042_words.txt , a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, 
how many are triangle words?
